# Machine Learning Algorithms
### My implementation from scratch some machine learning algorithms using Python

Each algorithm is stored in a separate directory that contains a notebook and a .py file. 
- The notebook is used to explain how the algorithm is implemented
- The python file will store the code

**Please note that contents in these notebooks do not emphasize on explaining the concepts of respective algorithms. This is well done in many textbooks, videos and online articles. Rather, they will focus on the implementation of the algorithm itself in Python programming language.** But we do include helpful resources for reader's reference at the end of each respective implementation.
